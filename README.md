I made SPA with react and backend with Django-rest-framework (look into blog-app-backend repository). I used React with Typescript + MobX as a state manager + Axios for the queries.
Libraries: Draft JS for building rich text editors in React; Framer-motion for amazing animations and interactions; jwt-decode because I used JWT auth; SASS for the lovely SCSS.
About Application: it's a blog app where user can post different stuff, watch different things from other users and react to it. Firstly user can register account and uploud avatar. I also inserted notification system which notifies user about comments for example. He can create his own blog (or many blogs) which should contain many posts subject to the same topic. People can subscribe on each other to track following posts from this person. There's also good filtering system with tags. When user creates a blog/post he also chooses tags so other people can just click on the tag and it will show them all posts belonging to that tag (and of course you can choose multiple).
And I created killing feature thing in my app. It's called "Quizzes". Point of that is getting versatile feedback from readers. And the author can create quizzes himself.
